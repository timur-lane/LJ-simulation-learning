# LJ-simulation-learning

This contains the code produced whilst learning about the interactive, hands-on learning approaches to the modern physics curriculum.
This shows the progression from learning about the Van Der Waals' Equation of State, to learning about the Lennard-Jones Potential, to 
learning about the MBWR Modified EOS, and finally producing a simple molecular dynamics simulation of the LJ potential. The final result 
of the internship can be seen in the LJVideo file and hopefully it shows a progression in understanding about the uses of EOS and potentials 
to model particle interactions and an improvement in my ability to program in Python.
This was an amazing experience and I was able to take a lot from it.
